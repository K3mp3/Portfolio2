# Portfolio
This is the portfolio I've built for myself. It is made with HTML 5, SCSS, vanilla JavaScript, Three.js, Vite and ESLint. 

I started of by taking inspiration from other Front-End Developer portfolios.
After that I started working in Figma trying to design a portfolio I liked. 
It took a while, but finnaly, I came up with something that felt really good.
Then I started working on it in Visual Studio Code and now im done with the first version. 

Feel free to check it out!
